# 99-Accuracy-Exploring-Predictive-Power-in-Body-Metrics-with-R

🚀 Just wrapped up an intensive statistical modeling project using real-world anthropometric data in R!

In this deep-dive analysis, I explored the predictive power of body measurements on age and gender using techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

🔍 Key insights:

Variables like abdomen and thigh girth had strong predictive power for age.

Using PCA drastically improved the accuracy of gender prediction, achieving over 99% classification accuracy.

Applied rigorous model diagnostics (normality, multicollinearity, Box-Cox transformation) to improve robustness.

Discovered the power of dimension reduction in making classification models more interpretable and effective.

📊 This project not only sharpened my R and statistical modeling skills but also reinforced the importance of proper preprocessing and diagnostics in machine learning pipelines.
